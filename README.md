#### Inverted Index
- Implemented using `HashMaps`
- Index construction time for this collection is larger then for the incidence matrix, but O(1) for retrieval operations will get us better results for search with larger collections

#### Incidence Matrix
- Implemented using `BitSet`

#### General Results
- Ids are different due to 2 corpus instances being used
- TODO: Improve coprus to give names of books
